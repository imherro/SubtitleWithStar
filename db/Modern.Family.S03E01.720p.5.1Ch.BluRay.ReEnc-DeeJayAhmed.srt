1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,632
We're beginning our initial
descent into Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

2
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:07,182
Thank you for ?ying United.

3
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:08,759
Reckon we'll
be landin' soon.

4
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,810
Phil, honey, you promised.
Not till we got there.

5
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:12,229
Okay.

6
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:15,524
This year, we're goin' to a dude
ranch with the whole family.

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,102
Mm-hmm.
The family.

8
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,937
What if Dylan
buys his own ticket?

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,398
We'll be sleeping
in separate cabins.

10
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:25,735
What if Dylan and I
share a horse?

11
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,990
Mmm. I hate landing.

12
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,783
We'll get
through this.

13
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,577
Wow. it's so pretty here.

14
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,629
What are you doin'?

15
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,456
I want my ears to pop.

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,759
Try putting
a little rouge on 'em.

17
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,710
Nobody gets me.

18
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:45,922
Wow! isn't this beautiful,
little cowgirl?

19
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,549
You hate her sparkly outfit, don't you?
No, I told you, it's fine.

20
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,555
I just didn't like you
wearing a matching one.

21
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:54,434
So we haven't told the family yet, but
we've decided to adopt a baby boy.

22
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:57,141
From America this time. You might
say we're buying domestic.

23
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,976
In private. You might
say that in private.

24
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,982
Our adoption attorney told us
it would be a good idea ...

25
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,234
to make a photo book to
show prospective moms.

26
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,941
Yes. But he thought that Cam's
version was a little too "artsy,"

27
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:09,870
so we've decided to take a few rugged shots
at the ranch to, you know, balance it out.

28
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,989
I don't think it needs balancing out.
Really?

29
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,543
It's called
production value.

30
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:26,588
# Hey, hey #

31
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,671
# Hey #

32
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,261
Look. A horse!

33
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,314
Look, Jay! So beautiful!

34
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,266
Your ears haven't
popped yet, huh?

35
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,443
I'm like
the Horse Whisperer!

36
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,522
But something is making
this one skittish!

37
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,778
Whoa.
Look at the mountains.

38
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,325
They're amazing.

39
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,199
I've never been this far from
home before.

40
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,326
Now I've never been
this far.

41
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,282
Now I've never
been this far.

42
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,333
Where's a cliff
when you need one?

43
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:00,083
Look, kids!
A real-life cowboy!

44
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,164
Come over.
Come see, come see.

45
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,545
Uh-oh.  What's he doing?

46
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:08,595
Oh, my.

47
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,307
Ooh!

48
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,680
Yeah!

49
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,762
My name is Hank.

50
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,563
Here at the Lost Creek Ranch,

51
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,813
you're gonna ride and you're gonna
rope and you're gonna shoot.

52
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:27,069
You're gonna see a sky so full of stars,
it'll put your city lights to shame.

53
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,651
And when it's all done,
you might just encounter ...

54
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:33,658
a piece of yourselves
you never knew was there.

55
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,205
Are there any questions?

56
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,954
Do we book spa treatments
through you or-

57
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,331
I like you, kid.

58
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,629
I'm gonna call you Hollywood.

59
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,048
Th-That wasn't an answer.

60
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,876
And who's
this cactus ?ower?

61
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,754
What?
That's my wife, Gloria.

62
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,181
Well, she's Cactus Flower now,
Old-timer.

63
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,305
These nicknames-
Are they set in stone?

64
00:02:56,385 --> 00:03:00,060
Okeydokey.
You ready, gunslinger?

65
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,108
Heard word of trouble
in these parts.

66
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,067
Pull!

67
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,941
- That oughta fix it, eh, Jay?
- You got a piece of it.

68
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:15,287
I've been practicing like crazy-
all my cowboy skills.

69
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:18,115
Shootin', ropin', pancake eatin'.

70
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,793
Why? Because sometimes, I feel like
Jay doesn't respect me as a man.

71
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,041
It's just that when you say
"Phil is my son-in-law,"

72
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:26,840
it sounds like you're saying,
"Phyllis," comma, "my son-in-law."

73
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,959
That's ridiculous. Okay,
who's your son-in-law?

74
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,669
Phil is.

75
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,801
I'm not asking for a hug. I just want
to get that look of new found respect.

76
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,632
Like-
Oh!

77
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,389
Or-

78
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:42,682
Or- Mmm. Yeah.

79
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,356
Check it out.
Two birds, one leg.

80
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,358
Pull it!

81
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:54,072
- Not bad, eh, Old-timer?
- Huh?

82
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:57,997
See, Slappy only
had three fingers.

83
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,455
- What?
- He only had three fingers!

84
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,371
- Who's next?
- Oh, me, me.

85
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,798
Oh, this is good.
This is good.

86
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,460
Trés macho.

87
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,216
No smile.
Don't smile. Good.

88
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,763
You ready?

89
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,882
Wait, do I say "Pull"?

90
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,509
Sorry, sorry.
Whoa!

91
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:22,517
Mitchell, why don't you
go find Manny at the spa?

92
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,270
Wouldn't that be more fun?

93
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,316
Yeah.

94
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,817
I realized that if I was gonna raise
a boy, I needed to butch up my life.

95
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:35,322
You know, I wanted to be able to teach my son
all the things that my dad taught Claire.

96
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,421
Hey, Hollywood.
I don't love that.

97
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,670
You wanna see something?

98
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,170
Oh, my gosh! Is that a firecracker?
Shh!

99
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,755
Now I just need to find
the perfect thing to blow up.

100
00:04:56,838 --> 00:05:00,388
- Is that thing even legal?
- Not here. It's from Germany.

101
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,687
If they had this during the war, right
now we'd all be knee-deep in strudel.

102
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,901
- Watch it!
- What ya doin', eh?

103
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,822
You readin'?
Trying to.

104
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,242
- I'm not so good at it either.
- I'm not surprised.

105
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,819
That was a joke.

106
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,870
I'm Jimmy Scrivano.

107
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,791
You want to see me
do a cannonball?

108
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:28,037
I'd rather see you get hit by one.
Hah!

109
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,292
Good one, gorgeous.

110
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,135
Hyah!

111
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,805
Jay! Is this
like the lobster?

112
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,976
Do I get to pick one for dinner?
Because this one looks very tender!

113
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:46,021
Look alive, Old-timer! One of
your calves is gettin' away.

114
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,064
Somethin' wrong with my horse.
She's veering left.

115
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,187
When this happened to my uncle,
it was a stroke.

116
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:53,737
Oh, there's nothin' wrong with Buttercup.
You just gotta let her know who's boss.

117
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:56,986
Beautiful form,
Cactus Flower!

118
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:00,444
Beautiful! You look like
a dadgum conquistadora.

119
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,120
She's deaf,
but I can hear ya.

120
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,697
Why are you
riding that way?

121
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,908
I was afraid that cow
over there might bite me.

122
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:09,712
Oh, yes, he's gonna come up and bite you because
your leg looks so desirable with those-

123
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,584
Are those canvas?

124
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,381
Okay, Phil, ease that one
back over towards me.

125
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,000
Got it.
Ease him back this way.

126
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,801
Hup-hup! Hey!

127
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,754
- Piece of cake, huh,Jay? - Huh?

128
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,306
- Ease that one over to Bossy.
- Which one's Bossy?

129
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,054
That's my
nickname for your wife.

130
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,976
Hilarious.

131
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,516
Whoa. Whoa.
Go, Mom! Whoo!

132
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,269
Yo, Mom! You rock!

133
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,224
Oh, I wish I had a rock.

134
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,983
Hey. It wouldn't kill you
to be nice to Dylan.

135
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,859
It might.

136
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:40,988
What- Honey, I don't know why you always stick up for him.
Haley can do so much better.

137
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,537
Because I know what it's like to fall for a
girl whose dad thinks I'm not good enough.

138
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,751
All right. You're right.
I can make more of an effort.

139
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,828
That's the woman I love.

140
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,874
We take a little break over here?
Layin' some pipe?

141
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,093
No, sorry. I was just
talkin' to Bossy. Uh-huh.

142
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,511
Phil!
I'm sorry.

143
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,715
Jay, look!
I got this one!

144
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,139
I got this one!
She's veering left again.

145
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:09,517
When we get back, I'm gonna see if she
can track a pencil with her eyes.

146
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:13,226
Okay, Lily, I'm going
to push you one more time.

147
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,686
Now don't kick me, okay?

148
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,952
Lily!
I said don't kick me, okay?

149
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,997
You know, it's your own
fault that's happening.

150
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:30,076
- Why don't you try standing behind her?
- You are an idiot.

151
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,160
Oh, really? I ain't the
one getting kicked.

152
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,334
Why are you following me? Why are
you fighting me here, gorgeous?

153
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,336
This works.

154
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:41,386
I really, really don't appreciate
you calling me "gorgeous."

155
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,260
I just want to enjoy time with
my family, so if you don't mind-

156
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,558
Mmm-

157
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,182
Not a problem.
See you around, sunshine.

158
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,894
You kissed a boy!

159
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:56,603
No, the boy kissed me,
okay, Lily?

160
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,187
Boy kissed me.

161
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:02,570
# I rode a horse
for the first time today #

162
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,778
# I wasn't surprised
when it went "Neigh" #

163
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,784
- Hey, Dylan.
- Hey. Ms. Dunphy.

164
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,286
I was wondering
if we could have a little chat.

165
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,789
Uh- You want me
to go home.

166
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,792
No. No, it's the-
the opposite of that.

167
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:20,375
- I want you to go home?
- Mmm. Mm-mmm.

168
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:25,134
No, I, um- I want you to know
how glad I am that you're here.

169
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,011
Really?

170
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,309
'Cause sometimes I just get
this vibe you don't like me.

171
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,853
No. Dylan, no.
I'm sorry.

172
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:36,104
L- I like you.
I- I like you a lot. I just-

173
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,436
it's complicated, because ...
Haley's my daughter.

174
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,443
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

175
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,072
You are totally a hot mom,
but I can't do this.

176
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:49,496
Oh, my God! Okay.
There's- No, no.

177
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:54,077
I merely meant that I'm sorry
if I made you feel unwelcome.

178
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,709
- Phew! That would've been awkward.
- So awkward!

179
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,381
You know, but for the
record, Ms. Dunphy-

180
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:01,583
Yes?

181
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,464
If Haley wasn't
my girlfriend,

182
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,046
and Mr. Dunphy was
out of the picture,

183
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,177
I would be honored
to share your bed ...

184
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,679
and raise Luke, Alex
and Haley as my own.

185
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,678
Okay.

186
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,269
Good talk.

187
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,227
# She'll be runnin'
down the mountain #

188
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:25,066
# She'll be runnin'
down the mountain #

189
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:29,324
# She'll be runnin' down the
mountain when she come g;

190
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,700
The song ended
two minutes ago!

191
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,659
Well, I tell you what.
She could play Evita.

192
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:38,211
Really? You notice
the crickets left?

193
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,501
Anyone want more water?
Oh, Dad, I'll take one.

194
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,248
Heads up.

195
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,834
Oh, my gosh.

196
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,304
It was- It was dark. I couldn't see it.
Thank you.

197
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,426
So, did you set off
the firecracker yet?

198
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,975
When I do,
you won't have to ask.

199
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,394
First, all the
electronics will go out.

200
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,563
Then comes
the heat flash.

201
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,608
Afterwards, the living
will envy the dead.

202
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,856
And yet I'm the one
on the no-fly list.

203
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,906
Know what? Maybe next time I'll just
catch it and then hand it to you.

204
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,524
Oh, okay.

205
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,575
Yeah, let's do that. You do
everything, and I'll do nothing.

206
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:13,071
Something on your mind? This isn't
the right place to talk about it.

207
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,414
Okay.

208
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,037
L- I'm just-

209
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,461
I'm not sure if we should
have another baby.

210
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,083
What? Are you serious?

211
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,878
I think that we might be rushing into this.
Rushing into it?

212
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,630
We've been working on-

213
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,757
Everybody.
It's me, Dylan.

214
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:32,387
I just wanted to thank you all
for bringing me on this trip ...

215
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,218
and making me feel
like one of the family.

216
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,975
- Especially Bossy.
- Aww.

217
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,603
So, I can't think
of a better time ...

218
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:44,858
to ask something of the
woman that I love.

219
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,688
Okay.

220
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,109
No, no.

221
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:55,368
Haley Gwendolyn Dunphy, will you do me
the honors of being my lawfully wedded-

222
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:59,076
No. No, no, no, no! No proposals!
Not now. Not gonna happen.

223
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,832
- She's a child, so-
- Mom!

224
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,379
- You're still in high school!
- I meant after she graduates.

225
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,752
Not then, not now,
not ever.

226
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,755
Seriously, what are you two
gonna live off of?

227
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,087
The royalties from the horsey song?
Put it back in your pocket.

228
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,181
Would you stop it!
No, I won't. I won't.

229
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:16,635
No, it's okay.
I guess I'll just turn in.

230
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:20,143
Just so you know, there's a fan in my
cabin that sounds like someone crying.

231
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,607
Oh, God. Dylan, wait!
I hate you!

232
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,732
Oh, come on! Haley, get back here.
Phil? Anything?

233
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,690
I think you said it all, Claire.
You want me to rope her?

234
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,991
I can, you know.

235
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:35,616
For what it's worth, my second
wife was in high school.

236
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,210
Let's do it again.

237
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:45,672
One, two, three.
Two, three.

238
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,506
Gone.
it's gone!

239
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,173
It's over there!
it's not back there.

240
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,094
We counted to three!
Yes.

241
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,763
- Hey.
- Where have you been?

242
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,556
I slept on the couch
in the lodge.

243
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,511
- I know you didn't want to have a big fight last night.
- Well, I'm ready now.

244
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,721
Cam, I'm sorry.

245
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,897
Look, what if I can't do
the father-son stuff?

246
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,725
The hunting, the- the sports,
The Three Stooges.

247
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,903
You know what happens in real life when
someone gets hit in the head with a ladder?

248
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:12,482
They go to the hospital and they get an M.R.I.
Never see that scene.

249
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,442
I think you're
overthinking this.

250
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,779
You know, I love sports. I love the Stooges.
We've got this covered.

251
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,411
No. No, you- you've
got it covered.

252
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:25,371
I'm just stuck on the sidelines,
pretending to understand the rules and-

253
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:29,754
You know, my dad was a rough and tumble guy,
and I just- I could never relate to him.

254
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:34,508
I don't know. I just don't think I could
handle disappointing two generations.

255
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,807
I think you're more masculine than
you give yourself credit for.

256
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,343
Oh, God!

257
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,679
Who puts a birdhouse
next to a porch?

258
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,692
Claire, I know that you're worried that
Dylan is gonna break Haley's heart,

259
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,862
but I see in his eyes that he's
gonna stick with her forever.

260
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,611
No matter what, he's always
going to be with her.

261
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,784
- On your deathbed.
- Okay. All right.

262
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,156
I can't take this anymore.
I'm gonna go find her.

263
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,659
No. You push too hard, you
chase her right into his arms.

264
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:04,083
You'll end up with a boob for a son-in-law.
Believe me, you don't want that.

265
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,206
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What?

266
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,004
Hey, have you guys
seen Dylan?

267
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,672
No. No, why?
I'm not talking to you.

268
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:13,126
He said he was going out for a walk last
night, and no one's seen him since.

269
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,836
Sweetheart,
I'm sure he's fine.

270
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,887
Maybe after last night,
he just went home.

271
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:19,508
Doubt it. He left his luggage.
We have to do something.

272
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,218
If he doesn't eat five times
a day, he gets spacey.

273
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,971
What would that even look like?
We'll find him.

274
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,648
Hank?
We got a situation here!

275
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:30,193
What seems
to be the trouble?

276
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,777
We need to talk.
What?

277
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:39,118
You stole my first kiss!
What are you talkin' about?

278
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:42,117
I had it all planned out.
it was supposed to be special.

279
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:45,871
Someone with a high G.P.A. and a
bright future, not a Mario Brother.

280
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,669
Fine! You know what?
I don't even want your kiss.

281
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,247
Here, you can
have it back.

282
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,549
There.
Now we're even.

283
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,592
Keep it! I don't- I
don't want it anymore.

284
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,972
What am I doing?

285
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:04,019
Okay, people.
Looks like we have a walker.

286
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,893
Right now he is facing treacherous
terrain, sudden drops,

287
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,852
mountain lions, hungry bears-
oh, and wolverines.

288
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,653
That is, if the hypothermia
didn't already get him.

289
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,857
Why did we come here again?

290
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,907
So, our best bet
is to split up.

291
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,985
You two are gonna take
to the north hiking trail.

292
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,946
Can I go with my dad instead?
Negative.

293
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:27,205
I need Buffalo Phil and Old-timer
to check the Snake River.

294
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,876
Buffalo Phil.

295
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,248
Worth the wait.

296
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:33,548
Me and Cactus Flower will
ride on up to Destiny Ridge.

297
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,466
Maybe I should
ride up there with her.

298
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,886
Negatory. That trail is
for advanced riders only.

299
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,714
- We don't need another dead body.
- "Another"?

300
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,641
Let's go!
Move 'em out.

301
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,472
Phil, help me saddle up
my horse, will you?

302
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,023
Well, look who's suddenly needed
by his father-in-law.

303
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,521
Phyllis.

304
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,273
Phil ... is.

305
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,023
Hey, Uncle Mitch.
What ya doin'?

306
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:02,577
Oh, hey.
Just- Just thinkin'.

307
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:06,247
You know, I've been meaning to tell
you, you're a super-fun uncle.

308
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,290
And I'm saying this
as a boy.

309
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:12,129
Uncle Cameron sent you over here, didn't he?
What? That's hilarious!

310
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,126
No, I love how you and me
can joke like this.

311
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,464
Okay.

312
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,634
Luke, look. I don't know
how much Cam told you,

313
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,587
but I don't think this is a problem
that you can help me with.

314
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,344
Okay, good.
Got my own problem.

315
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,593
Wh- What's that?
Can you keep a secret?

316
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,725
I kept a pretty big one
for 22 years, so-

317
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:32,899
I've got this new firecracker, and
I can't decide what to blow up.

318
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,485
Oh, Luke, that's dangerous. I know!
That's what's fun about it.

319
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,063
I don't get boys.

320
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,194
What is so great
about destroying things?

321
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,903
It turns stuff into
flying chunks of stuff.

322
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,283
Okay. No. No.
Give it to me.

323
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,909
Fine.

324
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,663
I take it back.
You're not that fun.

325
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,878
All right.
Hey, look, um-

326
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,880
We'll do it together,
all right?

327
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,463
You just made the best
decision of your life.

328
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:04,889
Okay.

329
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,973
Damn it, Buttercup!

330
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,271
What the hell's wrong
with this horse?

331
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,187
Jay.

332
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,143
Wow.

333
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,979
I want to talk to you about that
son-in-law crack you made at breakfast.

334
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,823
Oh, I didn't mean anything by that!
I think you did.

335
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:26,278
I get that I wasn't your first choice to
marry Claire, but it's been 18 years,

336
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,954
and there hasn't been a day when I wasn't
a loyal husband to your daughter ...

337
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,577
and a great dad
to your grandkids.

338
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,580
So if we've still got a problem,
now it's your problem.

339
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,918
Phil, wait up.

340
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:47,014
Can I ask you something, man to man?
Okay.

341
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,969
You notice anything funny
about that Hank character and-

342
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,850
Gloria? Yeah, he's hitting on her.
Why?

343
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,272
I knew it.

344
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,766
Where are you going?
Destiny Ridge.

345
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:02,022
Buttercup, hyah!

346
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,606
Seriously?

347
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,865
Okay. Okay, it's clear.

348
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,288
After this, we're gonna
have some angry birds.

349
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,958
Yeah. It's gonna
be Bye Bye Birdie.

350
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,832
It's a big musical
from the '60s.

351
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,538
No, forget it.
What you said.

352
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,589
Okay.

353
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,258
Okay. Go!

354
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,968
Cool!

355
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,716
- That's it?
- I'm sorry, buddy.

356
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,551
I brought that thing
all the way from-

357
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,511
Whoa!
Whoa!

358
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,562
Cam!
I did a boy thing!

359
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,940
I blew up the birdhouse!
You should've seen it.

360
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,938
It was so awesome!
That's great!

361
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,944
Yeah.
I think I can do this.

362
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:49,243
I mean, maybe not everything, and maybe not
right away, and not The Three Stooges.

363
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,158
No.
But ... I do.

364
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,205
I want a son.

365
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,620
I'm sorry I panicked.
Oh, that's great.

366
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,998
Now maybe we can go back
to taking pictures for the book.

367
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,000
Yes! Pictures of me
blowing up stuff!

368
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,707
Okay. I see
we've overcorrected.

369
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,590
I know you think I'm the mean mom who
wouldn't let you marry your boyfriend,

370
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:09,843
but someday you're gonna realize
I- I did what had to be done.

371
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,595
No, you didn't.

372
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:14,393
I was never gonna marry Dylan.
I told him no.

373
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,140
You did? Thank God. But it was
my proposal to turn down.

374
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:22,394
You know, you keep telling me to act like an
adult, but then you don't even give me a chance.

375
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,776
Well, I-
You sort of got me there.

376
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,108
But, sweetheart, I don't
expect you to understand this.

377
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,443
I certainly didn't
when I was your age.

378
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,279
I look at you as my baby,
and I always will.

379
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:37,705
It's just what moms do.
I'm not a baby anymore, okay?

380
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,377
And I am never gonna
see Dylan again!

381
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,377
Dylan! Dylan!

382
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,083
What?

383
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,051
Where are you?
Wyoming!

384
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:52,556
- You're okay!
- I had the craziest night.

385
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:56,136
When you rejected me,
I felt lost and scared.

386
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,141
And then
I went out on a walk,

387
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,848
and I felt a whole different
kind of lost and scared.

388
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,854
Then I fell asleep
in the stable,

389
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:07,063
and when I woke up, I met this woman
named Jake, who's strong like a man.

390
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,776
Then we had this long talk,
and he- she hired me.

391
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,327
Uh, wha- What do you mean,
she hired you?

392
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,118
I work here now.
So you're staying?

393
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:17,665
Yeah.

394
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,784
What about us?
It could never work.

395
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,835
We're from
two different worlds.

396
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:25,290
You're a high school student,
and I'm a ranch hand.

397
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,593
I'm just-
I'm so glad you're okay.

398
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,545
I really am. I am.
Thanks.

399
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,051
But we're not supposed to
fraternize with the guests.

400
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,598
Right.

401
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,894
Dylan!

402
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,232
Dylan!

403
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:46,026
You got a voice like a
meadowlark, don't ya?

404
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:49,402
Dylan!

405
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,699
I sure am worried
about that kid.

406
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,368
Dylan-

407
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:57,204
He ain't down there.
Oh, come on now.

408
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,658
You come up here
for the cowboy experience.

409
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,288
You're lookin' at him.

410
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,791
Do I look like the kind of woman
that would cheat on her husband?

411
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,749
- Yes.
- Really?

412
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:12,178
Hey! Think you better move
away from that woman.

413
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,381
Only we touch our women
when they don't want us to.

414
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,184
Easy. Easy there, friend-o.
I wasn't hittin' on this filly.

415
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,478
This is all part
of the package.

416
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,601
If I didn't
play the bad guy,

417
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,899
he wouldn't get to ride up
and be the big hero.

418
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:28,353
He doesn't need you to make him a hero.
He's a hero every day!

419
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:29,983
Why don't you
do us all a favor?

420
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,485
Get back on your horse, ride
down to the lodge and tell 'em-

421
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,200
Can you keep him still? I'm
trying to make a point. I am.

422
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,995
Okay, okay, I'm gone.
Ma'am.

423
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,661
Wait.

424
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,619
Wait! There's something
I want to say to you.

425
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:46,170
I will only be checking "somewhat
satisfied" on our comment card.

426
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,337
Oh, geez.

427
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,003
I mean, he was great
with the kids.

428
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,672
I looked it up.

429
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:59,305
The distance between our houses
is 2,443 miles.

430
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,512
Yeah, but on some maps
it's, like, this big.

431
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,848
God, you're stupid.

432
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:10,562
All in all,
it was a great vacation.

433
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,646
We may have lost a man,

434
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,615
but out there on the range,
under that great big sky,

435
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:22,164
we found a part of ourselves
we never knew was there.

436
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,708
Just like the horny cowboy
said we would.

437
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,874
No.
Oh, fine.

438
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,253
English - US - PSDH
