23
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,910
A few months ago I started getting these letters.

24
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,100
Who wrote you the letters?

26
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,490
"If I'm to be harmed,

27
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,050
"I need you to reach out to the other Howard."

28
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,120
Are we still together over here?

29
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,570
Are we happy?

30
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,470
A woman from our world was arrested... an assassin.

31
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,390
- They call her Baldwin. - She's here illegally,

32
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,950
and I need to find out who sent her.

33
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,810
- Not my concern. - Lambert, the ambassador...

34
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,610
think he might be working with these people.

35
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,980
Aldrich, they'll kill us all!

36
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,260
Waffe fallen lass!

37
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,970
Leave them.

38
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,490
You didn't give them anything, did you?

39
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,050
Your side is compromised.

40
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,640
I'm not saying it's your department,

41
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,090
but I'm sure as hell not saying it's not.

42
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,040
- We're fucked. - Not if we send this one back in my place.

43
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,360
We're after the same people.

44
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,000
They tried to take me out.

45
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,330
They might try the same with you.

46
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,140
Oh, my God.

47
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:08,910
Danke.

48
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,050
Gute Nacht.

50
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,760
I get to work every morning at 8:30.

51
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,950
I'm never late.

52
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,700
Howard.

53
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,950
Early, actually,

54
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,590
so I guess I get to work at 8:20-something.

55
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,410
Howard.

56
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,130
What are you doing in there? Packing? Are you packing?

57
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,750
- You said it might be a week. - You're gonna be living

58
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,230
in my life. You don't need...

59
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,050
Forget it.

60
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,810
Um, after work,

61
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,890
I, uh, I just grab a quick dinner,

62
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,960
and I get to the hospital between 7:00 and 7:30.

63
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,080
I read to her, but you know that.

64
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,280
Anything else?

65
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,490
Uh, most mornings

66
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,410
I-I stop for coffee down at the cafe.

67
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,950
Uh, Go. Uh, we play the board game Go.

68
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,000
On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I meet a friend.

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,520
His name is Andrei, and, uh, we play Go.

70
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,470
Jesus.

71
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,140
You know, they say it's so great

72
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,060
to meet yourself.

73
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,850
Bullshit.

74
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,290
Kind of like losing your virginity, you know?

75
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,260
Wait your whole life for it,

76
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,970
and then 20 seconds later, you're disappointed.

77
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,230
What are you doing?

78
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,460
In about six hours,

79
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,290
we need to become each other.

80
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,470
Even though, apparently, I can pretty much do

81
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,730
whatever the fuck I want, as long as it's not too exciting

82
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,430
or even remotely interesting.

83
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,130
If we really want to get to know each other,

84
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,490
let's play cards.

85
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,560
So, how'd you meet this Andrei?

86
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,570
Uh, we met at the hospital.

87
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,280
His sister was admitted the same day as Emily.

88
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,460
She's diabetic.

89
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,910
Any, uh... extracurriculars?

90
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:24,980
You mean...

91
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,390
Jesus, Howard. Are there any other women in your life?

92
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,470
I'm married.

93
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,060
Did-did you...

94
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,740
When she was still alive,

95
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,740
did you do that kind of thing?

96
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,900
So, let me get this straight.

97
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,460
Your only friend in this big old city is some guy

98
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,100
you didn't even know until six weeks ago?

99
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,040
Until six weeks ago, I had her.

100
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,580
What about, uh...

101
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,320
what about your routines?

102
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,480
Don't worry about me.

103
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,980
I work a desk job

104
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,190
and have absolutely no social life.

105
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,200
We've spent the last hour going over my stuff,

106
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,160
and you do I-I don't know what,

107
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,700
and your answer is, "Don't worry about it"?

108
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:21,920
Yeah. I got a guy.

109
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,350
His name is Raash. He'll take care of you.

110
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,920
You do realize we're the same person, right? Essentially.

111
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,790
I mean, the same flesh and blood, the same DNA.

112
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,560
Yeah. Believe me, I do.

113
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,620
Then why do you feel compelled to treat me so badly?

114
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,730
It's your bet.

115
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,120
You flopped top pair, and you're folding?

116
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,270
That was a good bluff.

117
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:53,650
Do me a favor, will you?

118
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:56,780
Play one hand like you actually know how to win.

119
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,270
Howard, play the fucking hand.

120
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,900
Are we finished?

121
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,140
No one will notice you here.

122
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,700
Fresh clothes.

123
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,300
Weapon?

124
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,860
You were in their custody for hours.

125
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,570
What did they ask you?

126
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,780
I'm sorry.

127
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,520
About what happened to your other.

128
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,340
She's dead.

129
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,580
And I gave them nothing.

130
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,750
I'll talk to them about next steps. Get some rest.

131
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,910
Howard, it's time.

132
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,510
Well, well, well.

133
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,020
You're saving the good stuff, huh?

134
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,680
That's not for me. Or you.

135
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,140
It's for when she wakes up.

136
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,170
Just one week.

137
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,530
You're doing the right thing.

138
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,820
They're gonna see through me.

139
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,580
Not if you keep your mouth shut.

140
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,440
You'll read to her every day.

141
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,380
I will.

142
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,670
Keep her safe.

143
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,270
Find these people.

144
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:04,790
Howard.

145
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,180
I'll take him, Cyrus, from here.

146
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,370
Thank you.

147
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,320
Do you have his paperwork?

148
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,330
Yeah.

149
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,690
All right. They don't do that, by the way.

150
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,170
What?

151
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,120
Shake hands. Berlin, on the other side, they...

152
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,280
You'll see. It's a germ thing.

153
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,370
Good to know.

154
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,160
Howard, if you are caught,

155
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,410
there's no one to protect you over there.

156
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,570
You understand? You're on your own.

157
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:22,700
Yeah.

158
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,560
I have to deny any part of this.

159
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,850
Okay. Thank you.

160
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:36,860
Danke.

161
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,610
Arms up.

162
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,570
Yours?

163
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,680
Oh, shit, I forgot.

164
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,770
Oh, come on, it's just a pack of bloody smokes.

165
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,830
Oh, for God's sake, it was just a mistake.

166
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,620
Come on, really?

167
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,050
Sir?

168
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,230
Purpose of visit?

169
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,380
Uh, the, uh, embassy pouch.

170
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,020
Welcome home.

171
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,110
I'm Raash.

174
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,070
Thank you.

175
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,950
Hey! Hey! What...

176
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,640
Come on, what are you...?

177
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,330
A little sparse.

178
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,720
I have a few contacts left at the embassy.

179
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,880
We'll put more escorts on Lambert.

180
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,600
If he has any connections to Baldwin, my men will find out.

181
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,130
Do you ever have doubts about these men?

182
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,600
I'm just wondering how we've always been

183
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,120
one step behind here.

184
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,480
'Cause we've been meticulous, right?

185
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,740
In our vetting. I mean, there's no...

186
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,990
There's no chance of any point of compromise here, is there?

187
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,860
Not unless you count Howard Silk.

188
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,490
You promoted him.

189
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,700
Well, that was the deal.

190
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,100
His other's gone.

191
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,670
- Why make deals? - Because, candidly speaking,

192
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,510
that man's been a lot more useful than your lot lately,

193
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,140
and I'd like to stay on his good side.

194
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:38,950
Was there anything else?

195
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,490
Ah, finally, they send help.

196
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,470
Thought I was gonna be in Strategy.

197
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,170
Yes, this is it. Strategy payroll.

198
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,820
You have a degree in accounting, yeah?

199
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,010
No.

200
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:15,810
Your desk.

201
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,340
They think what I do is a joke,

202
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,700
so now they play a joke on me.

203
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,870
Need to file every time card, mark it with code, send it back.

204
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:28,290
You take too long, I will find someone to replace you.

205
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,360
Questions?

206
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,420
Uh, where are you going?

207
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,660
Personal day.

208
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,130
What is wrong with you?

209
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,730
This is all his idea, I assume?

210
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:01,980
Groceries.

211
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,830
So, this is it?

212
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:12,460
Just you and me, locked in this apartment for a week?

213
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,620
God, I'm such an idiot.

214
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,460
Open the door.

215
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,250
I just saw Raash go in there.

216
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,430
I know you're in there.

217
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:27,640
Dad!

218
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,570
Your phone's been off all day.

219
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,330
Mom's in the hospital, we've got to go, come on.

220
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,850
- Mom? - Yes.

221
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,920
Your mom?

222
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,080
Obviously. What... get your jacket.

223
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,100
Come on. Come on.

232
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,210
Anna?

233
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:22,950
What?

234
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:27,820
What, uh... what happened to your mother?

235
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,100
It was another overdose.

236
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,990
Yeah. Neighbors found her on the floor.

237
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,180
Barely had a pulse.

238
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,390
She'd probably been there all night.

239
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,700
You're actually surprised?

240
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:47,980
I-I'm a lot of things right now.

241
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,840
Yeah, well, don't worry. You don't have to do anything.

242
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,430
I'll deal with the doctors when we get there.

243
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,010
Right.

244
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,770
Yeah. O-Of course.

247
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,840
I see you.

250
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,560
Two escorts now.

251
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,450
For some reason, they think I'm using these appointments

252
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,010
for clandestine meetings.

253
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,660
So, where is she?

254
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,680
She wants to keep working.

255
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,520
Says she told them nothing.

256
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,520
Told you she told them nothing.

257
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,350
Have you heard anything from home?

258
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,870
Towel, please.

259
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,320
Your friends are not happy

260
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,020
with how things have been developing.

261
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,740
They want to bring over our guests earlier than expected.

262
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,560
She hasn't removed the targets yet.

263
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,400
And on that note,

264
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,030
they also raised questions

265
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,150
about your assassin friend.

266
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,020
First they push me out of an airplane

267
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,910
and then they take away my chute.

268
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,510
They want her removed.

269
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,760
She trusts me.

270
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,060
That's putting it lightly, from what I hear.

271
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,210
Perhaps it's time

272
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,450
you actually use that situation to your advantage.

273
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,260
Clare.

274
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,620
I can't imagine the pressure you're under.

275
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,160
The weight of these expectations.

276
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,270
But after all the work that they did to place you here,

277
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,440
would you really risk this mission

278
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,780
when we're so close to the big day?

279
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,370
I'll take care of it.

280
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,220
You always do.

284
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,010
How are you feeling?

285
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,500
Thirsty.

286
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,020
Jesus, Em.

287
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,570
What happened?

288
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,180
There some reason you're here, Howard?

289
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,840
I'm...

290
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,170
Well, thank you for coming.

291
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,110
- I've got it. - Could you...

292
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:39,290
put your dicks away, please?

293
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,630
"Light a candle at St. Christopher's."

294
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,120
What the fuck does that even mean?

295
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,980
You want to know what I'm thinking right now, you prick?

296
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:01,750
I'm thinking this is on you.

297
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,730
Stay the fuck away from her.

298
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,880
Really? Just walk out in the middle of the day?

299
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,410
You want to be any more conspicuous?

300
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,360
That was your idea of a promotion?

301
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,600
- Payroll? - Well, I'm sorry.

302
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,940
It was the best I could do with ten seconds' notice.

303
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,330
Okay, what do you know about this, uh, Lambert?

304
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:48,500
Nothing.

305
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,810
I don't know, we got men on him all the time,

306
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,580
but he's a high-ranking diplomat, so...

307
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,610
- Really? - What?

308
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,340
You're married to a director's daughter, right?

309
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,950
Yeah. So?

310
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,490
What the hell's my marriage got to...?

311
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,130
I'll have you know i was on my own career trajectory

312
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,290
long before I met Roland Fancher's daughter.

313
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,840
- Okay. - Yeah, and I resent the implication.

314
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,330
I'm fucking good at my job,

315
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,430
and when it comes to my work, Howard Silk,

316
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,870
nothing gets past me.

317
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:25,610
So I guess you know all about other Howard's wife, then, huh?

318
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,010
She was an agent.

319
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,410
Housekeeping? Under Aldrich.

320
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,190
How do you know that?

321
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:34,880
'Cause she was my contact.

322
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,380
She reached out to me months ago,

323
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,960
said things on your floor were compromised,

324
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:41,700
she couldn't trust anybody,

325
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,010
and then she had a little accident.

326
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:46,820
But you know all about that, right?

327
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,450
'Cause nothing gets past you.

328
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,320
Get back to the fucking Office.

329
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,500
I'm meeting a friend this afternoon.

330
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,480
Who?

331
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,030
An old friend. Don't worry about it.

332
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,510
All right, we're gonna have to establish

333
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,440
a few fucking ground rules here.

334
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,180
Both of our lives are on the line

335
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,150
because of this arrangement,

336
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,450
so you can't wander around my world

337
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,440
like it's your fucking playground.

338
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,060
We're in lockstep from now on.

339
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:13,180
So who is this friend, and when are we meeting him?

340
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,390
What do you remember?

341
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,550
- Couple of pairs of feet. - Faces?

342
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,400
Ian, I promise you I'll talk to you about it, but not here.

343
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,030
It's not safe.

344
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,930
Well, let me tell you how this looks

345
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:30,910
- from an Office perspective. - Oh, here we go.

346
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,580
You failed another drug test.

347
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,470
You know that's not what this is.

348
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,760
In light of this,

349
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,410
Dwyer's requested a full evaluation.

350
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,860
See if you're fit to return.

351
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,150
He wants you supervised,

352
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,640
followed, monitored.

353
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:53,680
He could have burned you entirely, but I spoke to him,

354
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,350
bought you some time.

355
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,230
Talk to me, Em.

356
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,270
What's going on?

357
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,690
I can't talk about it now.

358
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,900
We'll fight it.

359
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,290
Pills again, dash of cocaine.

360
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,520
And just last week, I said to myself,

361
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,430
"She's better now.

362
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,640
You don't have to worry."

363
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:25,730
I'm sorry.

364
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,340
- For what? - For...

365
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,690
not being there.

366
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:32,980
No, you're not.

367
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,320
And fuck you, by the way.

368
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,620
Do you know what? You don't have to be here anymore.

369
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,190
I thought I needed your help, but I don't.

370
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,760
I want to be here.

371
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,560
Because you feel guilty.

372
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,510
Otherwise, you would have buggered off at the first sight of me.

373
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,970
- I'll go if it makes you feel more comfortable. - Of course.

374
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,310
But I-I would like to stay.

375
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:57,020
Then stay. Jesus, Dad, what's the matter with you?

376
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,930
We'll get her help.

377
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,160
Good luck trying to convince her.

378
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,520
We'll do it together.

379
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,710
So, who is this friend?

380
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,340
He's originally from my side,

381
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,440
but he now has an identity here.

382
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,000
But you didn't hear that.

384
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,230
Heinrich is here?

386
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:30,990
Guten tag..

387
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,810
Holy shit.

388
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,670
You're here.

389
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:36,890
Indeed I am.

390
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:37,930
Hello.

391
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,940
Good to see you, pal.

392
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,720
Come here.

393
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,570
Local?

394
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,900
Yeah, do you mind giving us a few minutes?

395
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,190
Here, sit.

396
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,060
Brought a little something for you.

397
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,350
Compliments of the other side.

398
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,180
It's good to see you.

399
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,280
I miss this shit.

400
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,390
It's terrible over here.

401
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,110
Nothing like home.

402
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,840
Here's to home.

403
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:31,990
Cheers.

404
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,370
So, how you doing over here? Okay?

405
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,140
Well, cover is decent.

406
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:43,800
Um, married a local...

407
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,540
who actually loves me.

408
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,400
You?

409
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:55,280
I think I'm having a problem with our old friend.

410
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,920
You know anything about this group Pope is working with?

411
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,360
Brought an assassin over here.

412
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:07,450
Lambert at the embassy's apparently a part of it, too.

413
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,520
Are you sure you want to know about this?

414
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,950
They're fucked up, these people.

415
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,890
Fanatics inside our Office.

416
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,920
And Pope is definitely involved?

417
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,010
Yeah.

418
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:25,070
He's been helping 'em move illegals a long time now.

419
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,480
He is what he is.

420
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:32,940
Yeah, yeah, don't...

421
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,210
I don't need the whole fucking speech.

422
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,700
How long ago did he pitch you?

423
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,710
Almost 20 years.

424
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,240
We helped build this network

425
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,270
and you're actually surprised

426
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,930
it's being used for this kind of shit?

427
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,370
Thanks, schatz.

428
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,880
Danke schon.

429
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,340
Five minutes till lunch.

430
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,740
Don't fight him.

431
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:11,040
Whatever angle you think you have, he's got it covered.

432
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:14,600
I'm a step ahead of him for the time being, anyway.

433
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,720
Sure about that?

434
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:21,050
Listen, there's something you should know.

435
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:25,690
There's a source on the Third Floor over here.

436
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:28,640
A mole, very high clearance.

437
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:31,540
They say he's been feeding Pope for years now.

438
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,600
Strategy.

439
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:39,410
High clearance as in director level?

440
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,710
You don't have a name?

441
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,960
Something's about to happen.

442
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:48,510
People coming over. Something big.

443
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,980
You go up against Alexander Pope, you'll lose.

444
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,910
- Danke schon. - Danke schon.

445
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,080
Sorry about the mess.

446
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,310
Can I get you anything?

447
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,690
No, thank you.

448
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,830
Make yourself at home.

449
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,850
Just a word on tradecraft.

450
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:46,070
My ex-husband

451
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:48,080
wouldn't have brought me home,

452
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,600
wouldn't even have come to the hospital,

453
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,000
and certainly wouldn't have lent me his coat.

454
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,880
Perhaps it'll be simpler if we introduce ourselves.

455
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,160
I'm Emily.

456
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,690
I... I-I don't know what you...

457
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,320
Well, let me guess.

458
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,220
You two were colluding.

459
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,900
He's had you brought over here

460
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,410
so that he can spend more time over there.

461
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:23,510
I'm... I'm-I'm not... colluding with him.

462
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,050
That's not how it looks, Howard.

463
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,380
He had me brought over here

464
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:32,020
and kept my locked in an empty apartment.

465
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,200
And what's he doing next?

466
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,160
He's, um...

467
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,020
...he's investigating something.

468
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,340
I-I don't know.

469
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,170
You don't know or you won't tell me?

470
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:47,210
Believe me, he did not keep me in the loop.

471
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,030
I mean, he told me you were dead.

472
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,520
So, what department do you work for?

473
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:58,320
Up until just a few days ago, I was in Interface.

474
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,550
Interface?

475
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,740
No, he hasn't worked for them since...

476
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,180
No, I-I know.

477
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,030
He hasn't, but, uh...

478
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,690
I was still there.

479
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,930
Perhaps it's best if we don't talk about everything.

480
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:14,850
Yes.

481
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,880
Best for everyone.

482
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,590
Why are you looking at me like that?

483
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,920
I'm sorry.

484
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,720
You shouldn't be here.

485
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,500
This isn't usual behavior for him.

486
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,160
It'll attract attention.

487
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,850
Oh, I forgot.

488
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:40,300
I, uh, invited Anna for dinner.

489
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,090
Is that unusual, too?

490
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,070
Yes.

491
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,410
Hi, Mom.

492
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,490
Dad.

493
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:10,500
Did you sleep?

494
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,280
What did they say?

495
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,430
They're worried about the situation.

496
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,110
But they're glad you're all right.

497
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,370
They want you to kill me.

498
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,670
We have to find a new crash pad.

499
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,360
It won't be safe for you here.

500
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,700
Three more contracts.

501
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,730
- Nadia. - I can finish the kill list.

502
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,130
You don't know these people like I do.

503
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,500
They don't tolerate mistakes.

504
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,240
Why are you protecting me?

505
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,070
Because I care about you.

506
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,410
You only care about your mission.

507
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,230
Is that who you think I am?

508
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,570
You think I just drop you on the side of the road?

509
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,320
You're not the only one, you know.

510
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,920
When I first crossed over, I watched my other

511
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,340
and her quaint, little life.

512
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,280
She had everything.

513
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,600
She was free and happy.

514
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,930
And I was alone.

515
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,440
Why are you telling me this?

516
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,200
Because it's a choice.

517
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,030
Loneliness.

518
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,680
Let me help you.

519
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:27,540
You're the only one who knows who I really am

520
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,540
in this whole fucking world,

521
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:32,850
and I would never let anyone hurt you.

522
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,130
I'm sorry.

523
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,000
No.

524
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,880
Anna.

525
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,010
Dinner is served.

526
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,210
Didn't know you could do anything but barbecue.

527
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,560
Well, I guess, uh...

528
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,880
you learn things living alone.

529
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,320
It's actually really good.

530
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:11,420
You always mess up a compliment with "Actually."

531
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,740
When did you learn to cook?

532
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,780
A cooking class a while back.

533
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:22,910
The secret of the chicken is to leave it in the oven

534
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:27,700
as it cools, and it helps to bring out the flavor.

535
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:32,290
It's wonderful, actually.

536
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,920
Always was your favorite.

537
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,540
Anna, how's work?

538
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,380
Anything but the subject at hand.

539
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:52,810
I thought we could wait until dessert.

540
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,510
What's going on here?

541
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,340
Going on?

542
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:57,230
Are yo...

543
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:59,100
Are you two getting back together?

544
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,560
- No. - What?

545
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:02,810
Then stop acting like teenagers.

546
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,930
Okay, let's settle down.

547
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:07,050
For a second, I thought you gave a shit

548
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,990
about something other than yourself.

549
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:12,200
- Anna... - Mom overdosed again!

550
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,720
And I'm the only one who seems to care.

551
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,230
Anna, please sit down. Please.

552
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,770
I'm so sick of being your mother.

553
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:25,730
I'm sick of being the parent to both of you.

554
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,980
That wasn't your fault, you know.

555
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,480
You were no part of that.

556
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:05,990
I know.

557
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:11,060
For a moment, it felt like I was, but I know.

558
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:16,190
Is she like that on your side?

559
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:24,230
When, uh... when my Emily got pregnant,

560
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:28,250
we went overboard with the clothes and the room

561
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:30,540
and the registry.

562
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:33,250
We wanted everything to be perfect.

563
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:38,100
I used to lean into her belly

564
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,340
and talk to the baby,

565
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:42,820
tell her what the world was like.

566
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,720
Seemed like when I did that, she would kick.

567
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:52,600
But, uh, she miscarried.

568
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:57,820
I'm so sorry.

569
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,400
We had already picked out the name.

570
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:06,690
Anna.

571
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,280
Look, I don't... I don't... I don't really know

572
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,720
how it is between you and him.

573
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:20,810
I mean... I could guess,

574
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:22,660
knowing him a bit.

575
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:25,450
But, um...

576
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:30,070
...however bad it is...

577
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:33,170
you're both very lucky.

578
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:43,810
I don't really know you at all, Howard,

579
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:46,490
but whatever circumstance made you

580
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,030
who you are...

581
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:52,850
...you're better than him.

582
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:04,880
I could stay here tonight.

583
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:06,740
Crash on the couch.

584
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:13,230
I don't need you to protect me.

585
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,880
I know.

586
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,890
Do you trust this man's intelligence?

587
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:39,420
He has never been wrong.

588
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,620
So there's a mole,

589
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,680
someone from the other side,

590
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,280
on my floor,

591
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:55,950
under Aldrich's nose for... years.

592
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:59,610
I mean, how is that even possible?

593
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:02,050
Someone got to Emily.

594
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:05,450
Who's to say they don't know what you're doing, too?

595
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:14,130
Bottom line is, I'm too exposed.

596
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:16,320
Until you find out what's what,

597
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,240
I think I need to stay out of it.

598
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,040
And how you gonna do that?

599
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:24,500
By being him, I guess.

600
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:25,950
Best I can.

601
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:38,190
That other Howard, he was with his wife...

602
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,080
...however many years.

603
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:44,500
He had no idea about her?

604
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:46,940
No.

605
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:52,490
I guess loyalty is his biggest flaw.

606
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:57,260
Mine, too.

607
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:42,190
Not even a good-bye?

608
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:45,790
I am clearly writing you a note.

609
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:51,090
You know, we could help each other.

610
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:54,410
I mean, the Office are watching me,

611
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,230
but they're not watching you.

612
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:59,050
There's a lot of stuff going on out there.

613
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:02,060
We could help him.

614
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:03,590
Sure.

615
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,170
Yeah, whatever I can do.

616
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:11,860
That wouldn't be strange for you at all?

617
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,060
Us, together?

618
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,080
I don't know. Would it be strange for you?

619
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:20,620
Yes.

620
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:22,430
Yeah, okay.

621
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,310
Okay, now I'm going.

622
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:32,570
Uh... not taking your pen.

623
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:37,780
Thank you.

624
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:13,660
Morning.

625
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:16,150
I'm going for a walk.

626
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:18,140
Probably get a cup of tea,

627
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:22,020
and then, uh, I think I'll just keep walking

628
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:25,490
and go wherever I want.

629
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:28,970
I'd like to have his keys.

630
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:36,850
Thank you.

631
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:38,180
Next time you talk to him,

632
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:40,220
tell him I love my new digs.

633
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:54,680
{\an9}*Where I lead me I will travel*

634
00:54:57,170 --> 00:55:00,560
{\an9}*Where I need me I will call me*

635
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:05,770
{\an9}*Well, I'm no fool, I'll be ready*

636
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:08,460
{\an9}*God knows I will be*

637
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:11,110
{\an9}*And in the meantime*

638
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:12,010
{\an9}*Make a little money*

639
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:14,750
{\an9}*And buy a little mercy*

640
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:21,180
{\an9}*Well, met this morning, now she loves me*

641
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:23,490
{\an9}*Says she loves me*

642
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:27,060
{\an9}*It must be easy, look around you*

643
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:29,180
{\an9}*All around you*

644
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,130
{\an9}*But you see the motion, you're not movin'*

645
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:35,470
{\an9}*And you don't know how to hold on*

646
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:39,020
{\an9}*You just keep it loose, don't get excited*

647
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:42,520
{\an9}*You know it's gonna pass before long*

648
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:49,790
{\an9}*Well, one is goin', one is stayin'*
